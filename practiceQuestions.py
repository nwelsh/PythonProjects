# Like Java, Local scope is within a python function, these can only be accessed within the function. 
# Global scope is a variable in the main part and these can be accessed throughout the program. 
# Local can be made glocal by ising global keyword inside a function 

# number 2 
# What is the difference between a tuple and a list?
# Both of these are used to store data. 
# A list is comma seperated values within square brackets. These can be changed. 
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fiveLetters = len(mylist(1))
# A tuple has values enclosed in curly braces. These cannot be changed 
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
