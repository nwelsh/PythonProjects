/* Java focuses on code simplicity. java supports primitive data types - byte, boolean, char short, not object oriented */

/* Instance vs local variables 
instance: accessible by all methods in the class
local: within a block, function, or constructor
*/
//instance 
class Athlete {
public String athleteName;
public double athleteSpeed;
public int athleteAge;
}

//local
public void athlete() {
String athleteName;
double athleteSpeed;
int athleteAge;
}

/* Data encapsulation: hiding data attributes and their behaviors in a single unit. setters and getters*/

/* JIT: just in time, improving the performance during run time. it foes the task of complitiing parts of bye code having similar functionality at the same tieme and reduces the compile time */
